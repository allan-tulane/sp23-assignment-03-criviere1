- **b.**
 **The work and span recurrences for the iterate solution are W(n) = W(n-1) + 1, and S(n) = S(n). The Big Oh solutions are W(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(n).**



- **d.**
 **The work and span recurrences for the scan (and map) solution are W(n) = W(n/2) + n, and S(n) = S(n/2) + 1. The Big Oh solutions are W(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(log n) because map has O(n) work and O(1) span, scan has O(n) work and O(log n) span, and reduce has O(n) work and O(log n) span.**



- **f.**
**The work and span recurrences for the DC solution are W(n) = 2W(n/2) + 1, and S(n) = S(n/2). The Big Oh solutions are W(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(log n).**
